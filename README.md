# 🚀 PayLink MCP Server

**PayLink** is an open-source framework designed to streamline payment integration for developers building AI agents and financial applications across Africa.

Leveraging the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, PayLink exposes a unified interface that simplifies access to diverse payment providers—such as M-Pesa, Airtel Money, and Stripe—enabling seamless financial workflows without repetitive integration work.

## 🌍 Why PayLink?

Africa’s financial ecosystem is fragmented. Developers often rebuild custom integrations for each payment provider, leading to redundancy and reduced scalability. **PayLink solves this** by:

- Providing **standardized MCP tools** for payments, invoicing, and reconciliation
- Empowering **AI agents** to handle payments intelligently
- Enabling **SMEs and micro-merchants** to access modern financial infrastructure
- Supporting **local-first** development with a global vision
